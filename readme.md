# Visitor Pass Management System (MERN)

A full-featured, MERN stack application for managing visitor passes digitally. This system replaces manual entry registers with a secure, role-based platform for pre-registration, walk-in registration (with OTP verification), QR code pass generation, and real-time check-in/check-out scanning.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (JWT):** Four distinct user roles (Admin, Security, Employee, Visitor).
* **Visitor Dashboard:** Logged-in visitors can request appointments, track their status, and view/download their approved digital pass.
* **Security Dashboard:**
    * Secure multi-step walk-in registration with email OTP verification.
    * Live QR code scanner for visitor check-in and check-out (with same-day date validation).
* **Employee Dashboard:** Employees (Hosts) can log in to approve or reject their pending visitor appointments.
* **Admin Dashboard:**
    * Full user (staff) management (Create/Delete Security & Employee accounts).
    * Advanced reporting dashboard for all check-in/check-out logs with search, filtering, and **CSV export**.
    * Report of all walk-in visitors, including which security staff registered them.
* **Digital Pass Generation:** Automatically generates a downloadable, digital pass (as a PNG card) with the visitor's profile photo, details, and unique QR code.
* **Email & OTP System:**
    * **Email Verification:** Users verify their email on their profile page via OTP.
    * **Password Reset:** Secure "Forgot Password" flow using an email OTP.
* **Cloud Media Management:** Securely uploads all visitor photos and QR codes to **Cloudinary**.
